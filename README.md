This is my first main project from the Odin Project. In this project, I built a Website for recipes. I created 3 hyperlinks for recipes for Pizza, Pasta, and Fries. Each one of the links leads to a page with a image, description, ingredients, and recipe of the Food. I used HTML only and implemented the use of different heading sizes, hyperlinks, images, unordered and ordered lists, italicizing, and bolding.
